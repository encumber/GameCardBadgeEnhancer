## Contact
feel free to add me on discord io7 or add me on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/client)

if you want to support me the best ways are either by sending me a [Trade Offer](https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/?partner=1053762784&token=sjVuSqZ0) on steam or by adding me and asking for a crypto address, any money that I get from this will go towards the robotics team that I mentor as that is where I find the most enjoyment in life currently.
